# edit-profile

This repository is supposed to represent an edit profile page. This is meant to be part of a larger web development project, where the goal is to create a social media page dedicated to travel. A user has a list of friends that they can follow and see places that they have visited, which will then allow a user to plan their own itinerary. 

This repository deals with the the editing of a profile page. A user can edit the following fields:

- First/Last Name
- Email Address
- Username
- A short bio of less than or equal to 256 characters

This page is developed in react and uses the react useState hook to keep the state variables of each of the fields mentioned up. The design and layout is also done with react-bootstrap.
